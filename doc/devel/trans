Goal: This minidoc documents analysis for general transition relations. 
      The goal is to keep track of ideas until the new feature is implemented

======================================================================

- trans from a clusters list to a clusters tree

- to help building of trans we might think to export primitives

- tree construction
  - nodes identify either conjunctions or disjunctions
  - leaves are clusters
  - we store subtree height into each node

- scheduling: 
  - quantification vars are no longer associated to clusters, but to nodes
  - each node represent a quantification node
  - from leaves (clusters) to parent we bring cluster's support
  - we bring up sum of left and right branches
  - after bottom to up, we proceed top-down to remove redundant 
    quantified variables
    
- images:
  - for and nodes: we search the deeper cluster and we conjunctivate it 
    with s(V)
  - and nodes: we propagate s(V) down both to the left and right

Whatever is out of the trans package has not to be changed. 
We might think to move trans package into fsm
